// if you're specifying externals to leave unbundled, you need to tell Webpack
// to still bundle `react-universal-component`, `webpack-flush-chunks` and
// `require-universal-module` so that they know they are running
// within Webpack and can properly make connections to client modules:

const fs = require("fs")
const path = require("path")
const nodeModules = path.resolve(__dirname, "../node_modules")
const externals = fs
  .readdirSync(nodeModules)
  .filter(x => !/\.bin|react-universal-component|webpack-flush-chunks/.test(x))
  .reduce((externals, mod) => {
    externals[mod] = `commonjs ${mod}`
    return externals
  }, {})
externals["react-dom/server"] = "commonjs react-dom/server"
module.exports = externals
